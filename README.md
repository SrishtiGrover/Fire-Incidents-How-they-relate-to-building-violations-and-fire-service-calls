"# Fire-Incidents-How-they-relate-to-building-violations-and-fire-service-calls" 

In this project, we aim to explore together three big datasets of San Francisco city on Fire Incidents, Calls for Service to the Fire Department and Building Violations, and find whether there is any relation between occurrence of fire incidents with 
      a) various types of building violations and 
      b) fire service calls. 
We study the extent of the probable effects of these violations in jeopardising the safety of the buildings, in turn causing hazards, specifically fire incidents.
